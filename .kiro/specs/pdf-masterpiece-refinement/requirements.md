# PDF Masterpiece Refinement - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification focuses on the artisanal refinement of our adventure PDF generation system. We have achieved a solid 90% functional foundation, and now we must elevate it to professional GM-grade perfection through meticulous attention to typographic hierarchy, tactical usability, and visual polish.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Professional Stat Block Architecture

**User Story:** As a Game Master running combat encounters, I want stat blocks with clear tactical sections so that I can quickly find the information I need during fast-paced gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a monster stat block is generated THEN it SHALL display abilities in clearly separated sections: "Special Abilities", "Actions", and "Reactions"
2. WHEN each section is displayed THEN it SHALL have a distinct header using Cinzel font family with visual separation lines
3. WHEN ability names are shown THEN they SHALL be in bold followed by a period for instant recognition
4. WHEN ability scores are displayed THEN they SHALL use a 3x2 grid layout (STR/DEX/CON top row, INT/WIS/CHA bottom row)
5. WHEN Combat Tactics are shown THEN they SHALL use stylized bullet points instead of plain text

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Typography and Micro-Design

**User Story:** As a Game Master reading adventure content, I want optimal text hierarchy and readability so that I can quickly scan and find information during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scene text is displayed THEN "Read Aloud" and "Behind the Scenes" text SHALL be left-aligned instead of justified to prevent text rivers
2. WHEN sidebar titles are shown THEN they SHALL have increased visual weight through uppercase styling or size increase
3. WHEN character cards are in the same row THEN they SHALL maintain consistent height using CSS Grid alignment
4. WHEN ability descriptions are displayed THEN ability names SHALL be bold with period separation for scanning efficiency

### Requirement 3: Professional Page Numbering System

**User Story:** As a reader of the adventure document, I want functional and aesthetically pleasing page numbers so that navigation feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages are generated THEN page numbers SHALL display the correct sequential number (not "0")
2. WHEN page numbers are styled THEN they SHALL include subtle golden borders or decorative elements
3. WHEN page numbers are positioned THEN they SHALL be consistent with the overall design language
4. WHEN the cover page is displayed THEN it SHALL not show a page number

### Requirement 4: Visual Hierarchy and Polish

**User Story:** As a professional GM, I want every visual element to contribute to usability and aesthetic excellence so that the document feels like a premium published product.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN section headers are displayed THEN they SHALL have consistent spacing and decorative elements
2. WHEN bullet points are used THEN they SHALL be stylized to match the fantasy theme
3. WHEN borders and frames are applied THEN they SHALL use consistent golden accent colors
4. WHEN text blocks are justified THEN they SHALL maintain proper spacing without awkward gaps

### Requirement 5: Tactical Combat Usability

**User Story:** As a Game Master running tactical combat, I want monster information organized for split-second decision making so that combat flows smoothly without document fumbling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monster abilities are listed THEN passive abilities SHALL be clearly separated from active abilities
2. WHEN combat tactics are displayed THEN each tactic SHALL be a distinct, scannable bullet point
