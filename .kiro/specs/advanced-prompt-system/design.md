# Advanced Prompt System - Design Document

## Current System Analysis

### Identified Critical Weaknesses

#### 1. **Adventure Generation Prompts**
- **Generic Structure**: Current prompt produces formulaic adventures lacking unique character
- **Limited Context Chaining**: No mechanism to maintain consistency across generated elements
- **Shallow Detail**: Prompts don't encourage deep, interconnected storytelling
- **Market Differentiation**: Content indistinguishable from generic AI-generated material

#### 2. **Image Generation Prompts**
- **Minimal Detail**: Current prompts are extremely basic ("Fantasy monster, [description], detailed art, epic style")
- **No Visual Consistency**: No system to maintain art style coherence across images
- **Limited Context**: Images don't reflect specific narrative elements or relationships
- **Generic Output**: Results lack the professional quality needed for premium products

#### 3. **System Architecture Issues**
- **No Prompt Chaining**: Each generation is isolated, losing narrative continuity
- **No Quality Validation**: No system to ensure generated content meets standards
- **Limited Customization**: No adaptation based on user preferences or adventure themes

## Advanced Prompt System Architecture

### Core Components

```typescript
interface AdvancedPromptSystem {
  narrativeEngine: NarrativeCoherenceEngine;
  visualConsistencyEngine: VisualConsistencyEngine;
  contextChainManager: ContextChainManager;
  qualityAssuranceValidator: QualityAssuranceValidator;
  marketDifferentiationEnhancer: MarketDifferentiationEnhancer;
}
```

### 1. Narrative Coherence Engine

#### Enhanced Adventure Generation Prompt
```typescript
const MASTER_ADVENTURE_PROMPT = `You are an award-winning Game Master and published adventure author with 20+ years of experience creating memorable TTRPG experiences. You specialize in crafting adventures that feel like professionally published modules with deep narrative coherence, interconnected plot threads, and memorable characters.

CORE CREATIVE PRINCIPLES:
1. NARRATIVE COHERENCE: Every element must serve the central story and connect meaningfully
2. CHARACTER DEPTH: NPCs have complex motivations, relationships, and character arcs
3. ESCALATING TENSION: Each scene builds upon the previous, creating mounting drama
4. THEMATIC RESONANCE: All elements reinforce the adventure's central themes
5. MEMORABLE MOMENTS: Include at least 3 "wow moments" that players will remember

ADVANCED STORYTELLING REQUIREMENTS:
- Create interconnected character relationships with hidden connections
- Design plot twists that recontextualize earlier events
- Include moral dilemmas that challenge player assumptions
- Weave in environmental storytelling through locations and objects
- Ensure every NPC has a personal stake in the adventure's outcome

PROFESSIONAL QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Dialogue that reveals character personality and advances plot
- Tactical encounters that require creative problem-solving
- Rewards that feel earned and meaningful to the story
- Pacing that alternates between tension and relief
- Themes that resonate with universal human experiences

MARKET DIFFERENTIATION ELEMENTS:
- Include unique mechanics or twists not found in generic adventures
- Create signature NPCs with distinctive voices and memorable quirks
- Design encounters that subvert common TTRPG tropes
- Incorporate innovative uses of the game system's mechanics
- Add layers of meaning that reward careful players

USER PROMPT CONTEXT: "${userPrompt}"
GAME SYSTEM: ${gameSystem}
ADVENTURE THEME: ${adventureTheme}
TARGET EXPERIENCE LEVEL: ${experienceLevel}
DESIRED TONE: ${desiredTone}

Generate a complete adventure that demonstrates mastery-level game design and storytelling craft.`;
```

#### Context-Aware Element Generation
```typescript
interface NarrativeContext {
  establishedTone: string;
  keyThemes: string[];
  characterRelationships: Map<string, string[]>;
  plotThreads: PlotThread[];
  worldBuildingElements: WorldElement[];
  previousSceneOutcomes: SceneOutcome[];
}

const CONTEXT_AWARE_NPC_PROMPT = `Building upon the established narrative context:

ESTABLISHED TONE: ${context.establishedTone}
KEY THEMES: ${context.keyThemes.join(', ')}
EXISTING CHARACTERS: ${context.characterRelationships}
ACTIVE PLOT THREADS: ${context.plotThreads}

Create an NPC that:
1. Has meaningful connections to at least 2 existing characters
2. Advances or complicates at least 1 active plot thread
3. Embodies or challenges the adventure's central themes
4. Has personal stakes that create dramatic tension
5. Possesses unique knowledge or abilities crucial to the story

The NPC should feel like they belong in this specific story, not a generic character that could fit anywhere.`;
```

  buildContextualPrompt(elementType: string, basePrompt: string): string {
    const contextualEnhancements = this.gatherRelevantContext(elementType);
    const continuityRequirements = this.generateContinuityRequirements();
    const qualityStandards = this.getQualityStandards(elementType);

    return `${basePrompt}

NARRATIVE CONTINUITY:
${continuityRequirements}

ESTABLISHED CONTEXT:
${contextualEnhancements}

QUALITY STANDARDS:
${qualityStandards}

Ensure this element enhances rather than contradicts the established narrative and maintains the professional quality standard throughout.`;
  }

  private gatherRelevantContext(elementType: string): string {
    // Gather all relevant context from previous generations
    const relevantHistory = this.generationHistory.filter(step => 
      this.isRelevantToElement(step, elementType)
    );

    return relevantHistory.map(step => 
      `- ${step.elementType}: ${step.keyDetails}`
    ).join('\n');
  }
}
```

interface QualityMetrics {
  narrativeCoherence: number;
  characterDepth: number;
  plotComplexity: number;
  thematicConsistency: number;
  marketDifferentiation: number;
  technicalQuality: number;
}

const QUALITY_VALIDATION_PROMPT = `Analyze the generated content for professional quality standards:
