# Advanced Prompt System - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive overhaul of our prompt engineering system to achieve market-leading quality in both adventure generation and visual consistency. The goal is to create prompts that generate adventures with perfect narrative coherence and images with maximum detail and thematic consistency.

## Current System Analysis

### Identified Weaknesses
1. **Generic Adventure Generation**: Prompts may produce formulaic content lacking unique character
2. **Image Inconsistency**: Visual elements may not maintain thematic coherence across the adventure
3. **Narrative Disconnection**: Images may not accurately reflect specific story elements
4. **Limited Detail Depth**: Both story and image prompts may lack the specificity needed for premium quality
5. **Market Positioning**: Current prompts may not differentiate us from competitors

3. WHEN images are created THEN they SHALL demonstrate professional illustration quality
4. WHEN content is compared THEN it SHALL be distinguishable from competitor products
5. WHEN users evaluate quality THEN they SHALL recognize premium craftsmanship

### Requirement 4: Contextual Prompt Chaining

**User Story:** As a system, I want each prompt to build upon previous context so that generated content maintains perfect continuity and deepening complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN subsequent prompts are generated THEN they SHALL reference and build upon previous content
2. WHEN images are created THEN they SHALL incorporate specific details from the narrative context
3. WHEN characters appear in multiple scenes THEN their visual representation SHALL remain consistent
4. WHEN story elements are referenced THEN they SHALL maintain established details and relationships
5. WHEN the adventure progresses THEN complexity and stakes SHALL escalate appropriately

### Requirement 5: Professional Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a quality assurance system, I want automated validation of generated content so that only premium-quality adventures reach users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is generated THEN it SHALL be automatically validated for quality and consistency
2. WHEN narrative elements are created THEN they SHALL be checked for logical coherence
3. WHEN images are generated THEN they SHALL be validated for thematic appropriateness
4. WHEN quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically request regeneration
5. WHEN final content is delivered THEN it SHALL meet professional publication standards
