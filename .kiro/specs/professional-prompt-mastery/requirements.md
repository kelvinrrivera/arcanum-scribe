# Requirements Document: Professional Prompt Mastery

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical gap between our current 52.2% capability and the 100% professional-grade functionality required to compete with commercial TTRPG tools. Based on comprehensive analysis of complex professional prompts, we must implement advanced GM tools, sophisticated mechanics, and editorial-quality formatting to achieve market readiness.

The goal is to transform Arcanum Scribe from a functional basic tool into a premium professional solution that exceeds industry standards in consistency, completeness, and usability.
