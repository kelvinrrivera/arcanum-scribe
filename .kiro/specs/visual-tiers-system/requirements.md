# Visual Tiers System - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification implements a sophisticated visual hierarchy system that treats images differently based on their narrative and functional purpose, creating dramatic pacing and professional presentation in adventure PDFs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Tier 1 - Splash Art System

**User Story:** As a Game Master, I want the most important visual elements (cover and boss monster) to have maximum dramatic impact so that they create memorable "wow moments" during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cover image is displayed THEN it SHALL occupy the full page without margins for maximum impact
2. WHEN the main boss monster is presented THEN it SHALL receive a full-page or half-page dramatic presentation before its stat block
3. WHEN a boss monster image is shown THEN it SHALL be separate from the stat block to create anticipation and drama
4. WHEN splash art is rendered THEN it SHALL use the highest quality and largest size available

### Requirement 2: Tier 2 - Context and Atmosphere Images

**User Story:** As a Game Master, I want scene and NPC images to provide visual context without overwhelming the tactical information so that I can quickly reference them during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scene images are displayed THEN they SHALL occupy approximately one-third of the page at the beginning of scene descriptions
2. WHEN NPC portraits are shown THEN they SHALL be integrated into character cards at appropriate sizes
3. WHEN context images are rendered THEN they SHALL enhance readability without competing with text content
4. WHEN multiple context images appear THEN they SHALL maintain consistent sizing and placement

### Requirement 3: Tier 3 - Iconography and Flavor Art

**User Story:** As a Game Master, I want smaller visual elements (magic items, minor monsters) to enhance usability and add personality without taking excessive space so that the document remains functional and beautiful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN magic item images are displayed THEN they SHALL appear as small icons within item cards
2. WHEN minor monster images are shown THEN they SHALL be smaller than boss monsters to create visual hierarchy
3. WHEN flavor art is rendered THEN it SHALL complement the design without dominating the layout
4. WHEN iconography is used THEN it SHALL maintain consistent styling and proportions

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Visual Gallery

**User Story:** As a Game Master, I want a functional visual gallery that serves as player handouts so that I can easily show images to players during gameplay without revealing spoilers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the visual gallery is generated THEN it SHALL be titled "Player Visual Aids" or similar functional name
2. WHEN gallery images are selected THEN they SHALL include only player-safe content (NPCs, scenes, magic items)
3. WHEN monster images are considered for gallery THEN they SHALL be excluded to maintain mystery
4. WHEN gallery layout is rendered THEN it SHALL be optimized for easy reference during gameplay

### Requirement 5: Image Classification and Processing

**User Story:** As a system, I want to automatically classify and process images according to their tier so that the visual hierarchy is applied consistently without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are processed THEN the system SHALL automatically identify image types and purposes
2. WHEN boss monsters are detected THEN they SHALL be flagged for Tier 1 treatment
3. WHEN scene and NPC images are processed THEN they SHALL be classified as Tier 2
4. WHEN magic items and minor monsters are identified THEN they SHALL be processed as Tier 3

## Success Criteria

- Boss monsters receive dramatic full-page presentation creating memorable moments
- Visual hierarchy clearly distinguishes between image importance levels
- Gallery serves as functional GM tool for player interaction
- Overall document pacing and visual flow significantly improved
- Image processing automatically applies appropriate tier treatments
